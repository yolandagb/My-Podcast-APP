Tech Test

Getting started
Welcome to the technical test for new candidates at BEETESTED. Here, we expect you to showoff your technical skills and make our brain explode ðŸ¤¯â€‹
The purpose of this test is knowing better your way of thinking, and see if that way fits with the rest of the team. Don't worry if you don't know how to implement the whole test, it's totally normal.

How to start
Clone this repository using:

git clone https://gitlab.com/beetested/tech-test.git


It will ask for your password, so you need to be registered at GitLab with the mail that you provided to us.
Then, create a new branch just for you, like this:

git checkout -b [YOUR_NAME]


And that's it! The project is yours to play with ðŸ˜‰â€‹

What to do
We will evaluate your skills using a fictional scenario: TUICH, the social network for videogame lovers (patent pending ðŸ˜‰â€‹)
At TUICH, gamers can have a public profile where they share their best gameplays, but it has a twist. You can only see other players gameplays by spending tuicoins, a fictional coin that you can earn by uploading new content.
Gamers start with a given amount of tuicoins, and anytime they upload a new video, they get rewarded with some more. Then, they can use them to watch other gamers' content; or spend them in the shop, where they can get skins for their favorite games or even discounts in some games.

What do we want
Doesn't TUICH sounds amazing? It would be great for it to exist, but don't worry. We know this is a lot of work for just one person â€‹ðŸ˜…
What we want you to do is just design the application at a great scale, answering this questions the best you can, and/or any other that comes to your mind.


 What kind of technologies would you use?

 How would the database look like?

 How many user stories can you define?

 What architecture would you implement?

 Can you draw a use flow?

After that, you may choose one of this features and go deeper in detail, even implement it with code if you feel strong. At beetested, we use Django for the backend and React for the frontend, but feel free to use the languages that you are most comfortable with.

Register/login and see/edit profile (keep in mind the tuicoins wallet).
Upload a video (or record it directly from the app).
Watch a video (keep in mind the tuicoins fee for watching videos).
Buy things at the store (for this, keep in mind that game companies may want to upload their own products).


How to complete this test
For the first part of the test, what we want is analysis documents, so you can create a new folder and respond there with anything you need (written documents, draws, schemas... Whatever you need to explain yourself).
For the second part, we want to see you code a little. Select one of the features and implement it to the level that you are comfortable with. Please, do it in another folder so you can add a README. If you don't have time to implement it fully, don't worry: just detail the next steps in the README. It would be great if you also use that README to write some instructions on how to execute and test your code.

Finish
To finish, just commit and push the project to your branch, and send us an email to tech@beetested.com with a link to the commit.
Have fun! â€‹ðŸ˜Š
